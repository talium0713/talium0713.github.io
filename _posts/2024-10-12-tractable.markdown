Our theoretical results show that approximating the infinite-dimensional return distribution with a finite number of moment functionals is the only method to learn the statistical information unbiasedly including nonlinear statistical functional. Second, we propose a provably efficient algorithm, SF-LSVI, achieving a regret bound of $$\tilde{O}(d_E H^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{K})$$.
