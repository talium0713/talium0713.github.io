We prove that the optimal power allocation policy that maximizes the sum-rate is an increasing function for harvested energy, channel gains, and remaining battery, regardless of the number of users in the downlink channels. 
We use this proof as a mathematical basis for the construction of a shallow neural network that can fully reflect the increasing property of the optimal policy.
