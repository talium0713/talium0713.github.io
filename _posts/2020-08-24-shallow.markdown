This article considers a power allocation problem in energy harvesting downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems in which a transmitter sends desired messages to their respective receivers by using harvested energy. 
To tackle this problem, we make use of a reinforcement learning approach based on a shallow neural network structure.
